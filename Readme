An unauthorized transaction is a transaction that was not performed by you and did not allow anyone else to make. Fraudulent transactions could be made by any stranger or someone you do not know, or someone who steals your card or account information for personal benefits. A fraudulent transaction is one unauthorized by the credit card holder. Such transactions are categorized as lost, stolen, not received, issued on a fraudulent application, counterfeit, fraudulent processing of transactions, account takeover or other fraudulent conditions as defined by the card company or the member company.
